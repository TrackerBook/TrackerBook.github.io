## Welcome to Tracker Book

Tracker Book is an application to record reviewed/read books so you will never forget what you have read!

You can just upload book file(s) to the application and it will save it into its database. So you will be able to search/see all your books in one place.

Moreover, you can mark any books as deleted to archive it, and finish the book to emphasize that you have read the bool.

In addition to that, you can add tags to the books to organize your bool collection!

Hope you will enjoy this small application and find it useful!

Wish you the best and stay safe!
